# Visualizing Global Media Trends: Movies & TV (1947â€“2025)

 **Project Overview**  
Built interactive dashboards using Tableau and Streamlit to explore international weekend box office performance (Febâ€“March 2025) and global TV show popularity (1947â€“2025). Data was scraped and compiled to help streaming services make data-driven, globally inclusive content decisions.

## Goals
- Highlight international media trends often overlooked by U.S.-centric streaming services.
- Empower content teams to select globally successful films and shows.
- Build a user-friendly dashboard for visual storytelling using real-world data.

## Technologies Used
- Python (web scraping with BeautifulSoup)
- Tableau Public (visualization)
- Streamlit (interactive dashboard front-end)
- Pandas, CSV for data formatting

## Methodology
- **Movies**: Scraped Box Office Mojoâ€™s international weekend gross tables (2025), extracting:
  - Country/Area  
  - Weekend dates  
  - Number of releases  
  - Top release per country  
  - Distributor  
  - Weekend gross earnings  
- **TV Shows**: Used Tableau Web Connector to analyze global TV show metadata (vote count, release year, origin country) from 1947â€“2025.
- Built separate Tableau dashboards for movies and TV shows.
- Integrated into a Streamlit app using screenshots and external dashboard links.

## Key Insights

### Movie Trends
- **South Korea** was the highest-grossing region during Febâ€“March 2025.
- *"Mickey 7"* earned the highest weekend gross globally.
- Major distributors like **Lotte Entertainment** and **Toho** held strong market share.

###TV Show Trends
- Strong correlation between vote count and average rating.
- In **Canada**, one of the most popular shows was French-language â€” emphasizing the need for cultural and linguistic diversity.
- U.S. shows dominated in vote count, but global trends varied significantly.
  
## ðŸ“‰ Challenges
- **Box Office Mojo** had no export option â€” data had to be scraped from HTML.
- **Streamlit Free Tier** does not support full Tableau dashboard embedding.
- Workaround: Used screenshots with redirect buttons to full dashboards.

## Files
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit front-end with visuals and buttons
- `movies_data.csv`: Scraped movie data
- `eda_movie.ipynb`: Preliminary movie data exploration and visualization
- `tv_dashboard_link.txt`: TV dashboard Tableau links
- `images/`: Dashboard screenshots used in Streamlit app

## Next Steps
- Upgrade to paid Tableau plan to allow direct embedding in Streamlit.
- Add interactive filters (genre, language, year).
- Integrate streaming performance metrics (e.g., from Netflix or Disney+) for deeper insights.
